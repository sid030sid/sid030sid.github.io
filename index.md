## About Me

I am a Student Research Assistant at the Service-centric Networking Lab (SNET) of Technical University Berlin. My enthusiasm for research stems from the excitement of tackling complex problems, exploring innovative ideas, and contributing to impactful solutions. 
I deeply enjoy the process of reading, writing, and presenting research that has the potential to drive meaningful change.

After completing my Master's in Data Science and Engineering, I aim to combine my expertise in AI with my research at SNET to advance the evolving field of Trustworthy AI.
In a world where AI plays an ever-growing role in shaping our lives, ensuring its trustworthiness is essential for safeguarding democratic values such as privacy, accountability, and the decentralization of power.
